## Research Question

Our question is whether the methods used in our article, "Using a different Essay content and style are strongly related to household income and SAT scores", would produce varying results if analyzed through WORD2VEC? Sepcifically we seek to identify the top 3 topics correlated with high income and low income? Are the results similar or different from those found in the article?
